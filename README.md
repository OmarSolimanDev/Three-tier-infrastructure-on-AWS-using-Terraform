# A CI/CD Pipeline On AWS Platform Using Terraform

## Project's Description

- Project aim is to build a full CI/CD pipeline on a AWS Platform
- this 
- Building a docker image from a nodejs application
- Using Dockerhub as our image repository to push the image to it
- Deploying the python application on a GKE cluster 


## Requirments

1. Linux os, Windows or Mac os  
2. A gcp account with a project and enabling billing account for it
3. The google cloud cli (gcloud) to be installed on your local machine [ Setup ](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
4. Authenticate your gcp account with the gcloud tool 
5. Terraform to be installed 


## Building Network infrastructure using terraform 

1. Created a vpc 
2. Created two subnets (managed & restricted) in the europe region
3. The bastion host is placed in the managed subnet as it will later it will <br />
    be used to control the GKE cluster
4. The GKE working nodes are placed in the restricted subnet     
5. Denying all inboud internet access to the subents 
6. Created a firewall allowing only The IAP range to access 
7. Created a nat-gateway in order that my resources that will be created later <br />
   can access the internet safely<br />

## Steps
1. Go to the `Terraform code` directory then Run `terraform apply --var-file dev.tfvars` in the terminal <br />
   to start the project <br />
   Note: <br />
   Before you run the command you need firstly to change some values passed in the `dev.tfvars` in order to <br />
   connect to your project properly

2. Connect to the newly created bastion host `gcloud compute ssh gke-bastion  --project=omar-gcp-project-1` <br />
   Note that: <br />
   there is no puplic ip added so gcloud will use the IAP tunneling to reach the bastion host <br />
     
3. Authenticate your account with the gcloud tool `gcloud auth login` it will pop up a browswer page  <br /> 
   where you can login with your gcp account

4. Inside the `jenkins_deployment` directory you will find deployments, service templates files which will <br />
   be used to create jenkins master pod to build the pipline

5. The bastion host  communicate with Master node due to the a startup script `startup_script.sh`  <br />
    Note That: <br /> 
    the startup script installs kubectl tool which is used to communicate with Master node, moreover <br />
    we created a service account with `container.admin` premission to have full access to the gke <br />
    cluster and attached it to the bastion host while creating the bastion host from the terraform <br />
    code

6. Now copy the kubernetes yaml files found in templates folder from your local machine to your <br />
    bastion host, type in the terminal: <br />
    `gcloud compute scp --recurse ../jenkins_deployment gke-bastion:~/ --project=omar-gcp-project-1` <br />
    Note that: <br />
    `gke-bastion` is the name of the bastion host

7. Authenticate the kubectl with the gke cluster `gcloud container clusters get-credentials  my-gke-cluster `
    Note that: <br />
    `my-gke-cluster` is the name of the cluster 

8. Change directory to `jenkins_deployment` by typing `cd ./jenkins_deployment`

9. Inside the bastion host create the namespace that jenkins will run on `kubectl create namespace master`


10. Inside the bastion host create the namespace that the deployed application will run on `kubectl create namespace dev`


11. Now run the following command to start all deploymet and service files. `kubectl create -Rf .`<br />

12. wait 1-2 minutes for the the jenkins pod to be running then run `kubectl get svc -n master`<br />
![](./images/svc.png "svc")

13. You need to get the initial admin password `kubectl logs [pod-id] -n master `.<br />
![](./images/pass.png "admin password")

12. Copy the  `External-ip:8080` address to your browser.<br />
![](./images/browser.png "testing")

13. Now refer to the `README.md` file  inside the `jenkins_deployment` directory to complete <br />
    the installation guide.
